This module extends apache solr search functionality
by adding Taxonomy Custom Fields to the search index

Currently the module is hardcoded to only add a specific taxonomy field
called "field_cue_words" to the search index.
 
TODO:
  make the module generic so you can include any custom taxonomy 
  field type in the search index by enabling a checkbox in the 
  Taxonomy "Manage fields" UI
